# wearybot
a discord bot with random-ass commands and is the sexiest bot in the world (based off my gf)
also had a minecraft skin and classicube skin grabber coming soon


# How to setup
1. Be sure to have python installed to run the program
https://www.python.org/downloads/

2. Next up you have to download discord.py 
to do that you do pip install discord.py 

3. At the end of the script there should be a client.run('token') yeah you should replace 'token' with your discord bots token

4. Last of all you type in python main.py in the directory of main.py or run the batch script I provided that does step 2 for you
